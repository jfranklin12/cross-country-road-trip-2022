        description: `Let our road trip begin! After two long days of packing, we were finally ready to get on the road! My fianc√©, Nick, got behind the wheel of his Toyota Tacoma with our U-Haul trailer towing behind him. I got behind the wheel of my Honda Civic, and off we went! Atlanta had been out home for many years. Atlanta is a fun-filled city! We spend our time Shooting the Hooch, riding our bikes, hiking, attending sporting events, and so much more! When you visit Atlanta, check out Fat Matt's Rib Shack for some awesome barbeque and catch an Atlanta United, Braves, or Falcons game!`,
