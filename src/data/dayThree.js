        description: `Chickasaw National Recreation Area is only about an hour and half from Atoka. So off we went! Our destination was the Bison Pasture Viewpoint. Just before the park is a coffee shop called "Donut Palace". We picked up a coffee and continued to the viewpoint. The bison were eating when we got there! We were so excited that they were so close and really easy to see. We took a quick stroll along the hiking path and snagged a few pictures. There was lots to do, but our day was booked with driving, so we got back in our cars and started off to Oklahoma City.`,
