        description: `Chickasaw National Recreation Area is only about an hour and half from Atoka. So off we went! Our destination was the Bison Pasture Viewpoint. Just before the park is a coffee shop called "Donut Palace". We picked up a coffee and continued to the viewpoint. The bison were eating when we got there! We took a quick stroll along the hiking path. There was lots to do, but our day was booked with driving, so we got back in our cars and started off to Oklahoma City.`,
