        stopOne: 'Chickasaw',
        descriptionOne: `Chickasaw National Recreation Area is only about an hour and half from Atoka. So off we went! Our destination was the Bison Pasture Viewpoint. Just before the park is a coffee shop called "Donut Palace". We picked up a coffee and continued to the viewpoint. The bison were eating when we got there! We were so excited that they were so close and really easy to see. We took a quick stroll along the hiking path and snagged a few pictures. There was lots to do, but our day was booked with driving, so we got back in our cars and started off to Oklahoma City.`,

        stopTwo: 'Oklahoma City',
        descriptionTwo: `Oklahoma City was a great place to stop. We were able to park the trailer on the outside of town and take the Civic to explore. We stopped at a delicious Mexican restaurant for a quick bite, and explored some of the boutiques that are all around the city. It wouldn't be a trip to Oklahoma City without stopping by Toby Keith's bar and restaurant! We popped in to see his place, and off we went!`,

        stopThree: 'Red Rock',
        descriptionThree: `Red Rock Canyon is a state park about an hour drive from Oklahoma City. It was a cool, crisp, windy day, but we still wanted to check out this place! We got our picture in the beautiful canyon, and got back on our way.`,

        stopOne: 'The Border',
        descriptionOne: `We made it to Texas! There's a rest stop on Route 40 as soon as you get into Texas, but 10 out of 10 would not reccomend! There were no bathrooms, just a big open lane for truckers to stop. It was worth it to get our picture with the welcome sign, but that's it!`,

        stopTwo: 'Amarillo',
        descriptionTwo: `It's 90 minutes to Amarillo from the border. We made it to The Country Inn and Suites around 7:30. We didn't spend much time exploring, but Amarillo is a big enough city to have great grocery stores! We got some frozen meals and snacks at the Target, and had a nice long evening to rest before heading off to Albequerque in the morning!`,
