        description: `Arkansas is a beautiful state! From Tunica, it's a 4 hour drive to Hot Springs, Arkanasas. After driving through Memphis, We took I-40 to I-30, passing through Little Rock. From I-30, we exited to route 70. This was one of the most spectacular drives I have ever done. The time of year created a blanket of orange, yellow, red, and green leaves that covered ever inch of the hill sides down into Hot Springs.`,
